        Usage:

        SETUP:

            1) Instantiate the OgreSprites::SpriteHandler object as usual with a standard new,
            and leave it in a place that your program will be able to access the pointer later.
 
                OgreSprites::SpriteHandler* spriteHandler = new OgreSprites::SpriteHandler();

            2) Give the SpriteHandler a resource path, this *must* be done or you won't be able to load
              any sprites. Naturally, change the path to match where you save your sprites.

                spriteHandler->SetSpriteLocation("../sprites");

            3) Load your sprites, manually. Notice we aren't using the standard Ogre::Material concept, 
              we're just loading regular old textures.
                spriteHandler->LoadSprite("sprite.png");
                spriteHandler->LoadSprite("sprite2.png");
                spriteHandler->LoadSprite("folder/sprite3.png");

            4) Initialize the library, giving it your current Ogre scene manager and viewport.

                spriteHandler->Init(mSceneMgr, mWindow->getViewport(0));
        
        METRICS:

        - Decide on your metrics. The SpriteManager can interpret both screen values and sprite locations 
          in three different ways. If I've  made this unreasonably complicated, just stick to the defaults 
          and you'll be fine.

        - OSPRITE_METRIC_RELATIVE: This is the default screen metric. It considers the screen location from
          (0.0, 0.0) -> (1.0, 1.0) going from top left to bottom right of the screen. For sprites, the same 
          locations represent the top left to bottom right of the sprite texture. Using this metric for your 
          screen values ensures that your sprites will always been drawn in the same relative screen 
          position, regardless of the size (or resolution) of your viewport. Using it for your sprites is not 
          recommended, since your sprite data is usually static, it is often better to use
          OSPRITE_METRIC_PIXEL instead for sprites.

        - OSPRITE_METRIC_OGRE: This metric is the default for Ogre's internal drawing system, and although 
          similar to OSPRITE_METRIC_RELATIVE, it goes from (-1, 1) to (1, -1) from top left to bottom right. 
          You can not use this metric for sprites. 

        - OSPRITE_METRIC_PIXELS: This is the default sprite metric. This metric works in actual pixel 
          locations. If you use this for your screen metric, you will always be drawing in the same pixel 
          locations, regardless of screen resolution. Since this is often undesireable, it is recommended you 
          use OSPRITE_METRIC_RELATIVE for screen metrics.

        DRAWING:

        - You can draw your sprites using whichever of the various DrawSprite methods suits your needs. 
          I've forced myself to contain my code bloat and keep them to only three. There's lots of room 
          to expand on them if you want specialized drawing concepts.

        - Method 1: DrawSprite using fixed location and the entire sprite.

            DrawSprite("spriteName", xLocation, yLocation, alphaValue);

        - Method 2: DrawSprite using fixed destination size and partial sprite.

            DrawSprite("spriteName", xLocation, yLocation, OgreSprites::Rect(spriteX1, spriteY1, spriteX2, spriteY2), alphaValue);

        - Method 2: DrawSprite using arbitrary destination size and partial sprite.

            DrawSprite("spriteName", OgreSprites::Rect(destX1, destY1, destX2, destY2), OgreSprites::Rect(spriteX1, spriteY1, spriteX2, spriteY2), alphaValue);

        SHUTDOWN:

        - Call spriteHandler->Shutdown() during program shutdown, and delete the pointer normally. 
          That's it!
