# Urho Sample Platformer

This is the first Urho3D sample project developed for the Unofficial Urho wiki: http://urho3d.wikia.com/  
The USP page there with Urho related details is at: http://urho3d.wikia.com/wiki/USP_-_Urho_Sample_Platformer  
See the wiki here https://github.com/gawag/Urho-Sample-Platformer/wiki for more game related informations.

## Build Instructions

Like Urho USP  uses CMake for building. I'm using Codeblocks on Windows but I also heard USP being build on GNU/Linux and Mac OS X.  
See http://urho3d.wikia.com/wiki/Creating_a_new_Urho3D_Project for details.
