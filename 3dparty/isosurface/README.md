# isosurface
A project testing and comparing various algorithms for creating isosurfaces. 

In an effort to find the best way of making a dynamic voxel engine, I've been researching new methods of extracting isosurfaces from data sets. I'm making my findings open-source. Some of the code is borrowed/inspired by existing implementations, but most is my own. It's not very optimized and it doesn't have much of a use outside of displaying data, but maybe you'll find some use in it.

See Game1.cs for a more detailed outline. Each class contains at least some documentation containing what it does and what issues it may have (None of the implementations are 100% working according to the original papers).

**This requires XNA 4.0 to build and run**


**Implemented and Mostly Working Algorithms**
* 2D Uniform Dual Contouring
* 2D Adaptive Dual Contouring
* 3D Uniform Dual Contouring
* 3D Adaptive Dual Contouring
* Dual Marching Squares (Schaefer's and Warren's) [2D Dual Marching Cubes]


**Notes**
* The 2D DC implementations don't connect properly; they were my first tests with DC and have some issues, and the adaptive implementation doesn't have simplification
* My QEF solver is hardly a QEF solver; Rather, it takes a set of offsets to apply to the mass point and find the one that has the lowest error, so do **not** use this as an example of what to do
* The QEF solver is disabled in the 3D DC implementations but can be enabled (simplification needs some tweaks); sharp features will be lost and mesh will be deformed if the error tolerance is high without it
* Dual Marching Squares currently doesn't move the dual grid vertices to their ideal locations to preserve sharp features


**Controls**
* Space - Adjust quality (ADC3D only)
* Tab - Switch algorithm
* 1 - Toggle mesh visibility
* 2 - Toggle outline/tree visiblity
* 3 - Toggle solid/wireframe/both rasterization
* C - Toggle mouse locking
